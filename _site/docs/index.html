          <p class="md:text-lg">Hello World! I recently found out that I really, really enjoy coding in Go and was surprised that the language didn't see much use in competitive programming. While I understand the fact that its standard library lacks the many regularly-used data structures for a competition, I can't help but see its potential.</p>
          <p class="md:text-lg">It shares a lot of the syntax of Python but has the speed of Java. When writing code against the clock, Go makes it easy to get a solution out fast. Also, it's just fun to code with it.</p>
          <p class="md:text-lg">Since it's hard for me to find many solutions to competitive programming problems and interview questions written in Go online, I thought I'd share my own implementations. I hope my solutions are helpful!</p>
